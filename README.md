PathVisualizer
==============

A path visualizer on a graph. Originally part of my Catan project, it kind of spun off into its own thing...

Draws paths for you, one at a time in the order they were given, and displays all available paths, as well as the length of the longest path.

A feature I plan to add is constant colors - they change right now, since the paths are stored in a set, which is not sorted.

So far no GUI path editor, but allows you to add any path you want in the main.py file, with some pre-provided configurations.
